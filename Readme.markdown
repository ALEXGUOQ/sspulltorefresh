# SSPullToRefresh

There are dozens of pull to refresh views. I've never found one I'm happy with. I always end up customizing one. This is the one I use that's highly customizable. You can just write you view code and not worry about the actual pull to refresh part.

For now, see the header for documentation. I'll add an example project at some point.

Enjoy.
